# Custom Malloc & Free Implementation

This repository contains own implementation of `malloc()` and `free()`. Demonstrating fundamental memory management concepts by implementing custom algorithms for dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

## Overview

- **`mm.c`**: Contains the core logic for memory allocation (`malloc`) and deallocation (`free`).
- **`mm.h`**: Header file with function declarations and necessary data structures.

## Note on Missing Files

Some files that were part of the original project are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. These files are required for testing and integration but were provided by the course and are not my original work.

## Usage

You are welcome to read and reference my code in `mm.c` and `mm.h`. However, please note that due to the absence of certain files, this implementation is not fully functional on its own. The missing files were integral to the project's testing and integration and cannot be shared due to licensing restrictions.

## License

My work in `mm.c` and `mm.h` is shared under the MIT License. Please refer to the `LICENSE` file for details.
